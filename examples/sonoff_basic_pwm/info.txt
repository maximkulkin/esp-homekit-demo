Modification of sonoff_basic_toggle example with PWM dimming as implemented in eps-open-rtos/examples/pwm_test.c

IMPORTANT: This is a proof of concept demonstration and should NOT be modified to attempt to control AC directly via PWM to the relay or by swapping out the relay for TRIAC!

Indirect approach needed to dim AC i.e. via separate daughter board with a TRIAC and zero-crossing detection circuit. Zero crossing detection facilitates synchronise of the PWM with the AC to stop flickering. Google "ac dimming" for more information.
