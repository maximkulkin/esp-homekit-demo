Modification of sonoff_basic_toggle example with PWM dimming as implemented in rtos example.

IMPORTANT: This is a proof of concept demonstration and should NOT be modified to attempt to control AC via PWM directly to the relay or by swapping out the relay for TRIAC!

The correct approach is to drive a separate daughter board with a TRIAC and zero-crossing detection circuit. The zero crossing detection facilitates synchronise of the PWM with the AC to stop flickering. Google "ac dimming"
